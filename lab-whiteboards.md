## Overview

Here's how it works, **pick a track** and you'll be given a problem to solve with your team.
You'll have **45 minutes**. Don't worry it doesn't have to be perfect. We'll go through the solutions together

## Option A - DevOps Whiteboarding Session

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Slides</strong> Read through the slides to understand the scenario you're solving. You can find the slides <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/slides/4_whiteboards_container_devops_nosolution.pdf" download>here</a> </p>
</div>

### Exercise Questions
(_Also available on the slides_)

1. You want to use Kubernetes. How would you define the Kubernetes resources for this application? ​
(e.g. pods, replicate sets, ingress, namespaces, etc.)
2. What would the CI/CD pipeline look like for deploying to the current environments? (Start with just dev)​

### Stretch Goals

3. Is it a good idea to deploy your monolith to Kubernetes?​
4. To re-build this entire application as microservices, it would take over 1 year. What would you do?​

## Option B - Architecture Whiteboarding Session

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Slides</strong> Read through the slides to understand the scenario you're solving. You can find the slides <a href="/slides/4b_whiteboards_microservices..pdf" download>here</a> </p>
</div>

### Exercise Questions
(_Also available on the slides_)

1. What would a microservices architecture look like?
2. How are you leveraging the [principles of microservices](https://samnewman.io/talks/principles-of-microservices/​)?​
